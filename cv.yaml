research:
  - researchName: Graduate Research Assistant
    researchWhen: The Dawn of Time - Now
    researchWhere: Cornell University, Department of Computer Science
    researchDescription: "Working with Professor Doctor, I spent my entire life focusing on a novel
      means of fooing bars. We found that while bars may be fooed, a baz may be fooed with 95\\%
      efficiency, as compared to a bar's 50\\% efficiency rate. Thus, by utilizing a bar-baz bridge,
      we were able to achive unprecedented bar fooing efficiency."
